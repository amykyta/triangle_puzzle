triangle puzzle
===============

This is an awful brute-force solution to the triangle-puzzle thing where
you have pegs that jump other pegs. 

It shouldn't be used by anyone for any reason.

This code shouldn't be looked at by anyone for any reason. 

If you must, though:

    ruby game.rb

The board is set up with nodes like this:

            0
          1   2
        3   4   5
      6   7   8   9
    10  11  12  13  14
