triangle puzzle
===============

This is an awful brute-force solution to the triangle-puzzle thing they have 
at Cracker Barrel for you to play with while you wait for your food. 

It shouldn't be used by anyone for any reason.

The board is set up with nodes like this:

            0
          1   2
        3   4   5
      6   7   8   9
    10  11  12  13  14
